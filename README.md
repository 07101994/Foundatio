Includes implementations in Redis, Azure and in memory (for development).

## Getting Started (Development)

[Foundatio can be installed](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Foundatio) via the [NuGet package manager](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/Package-Manager-Dialog). If you need help, please contact us via in-app support or [open an issue](https://github.com/exceptionless/Foundatio/issues/new). Weâ€™re always here to help if you have any questions!

1. You will need to have [Visual Studio 2013](http://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs) installed.
2. Open the `Foundatio.sln` Visual Studio solution file.

## Using Foundatio
The sections below contain a small subset of what's possible with Foundatio. We recommend taking a peek at the source code for more information. Please let us know if you have any questions or need assistance!

### [Caching](https://github.com/exceptionless/Foundatio/tree/master/src/Core/Caching)

Caching allows you to store and access data lightning fast, saving you exspensive operations to create or get data. We provide four different cache implementations that derive from the [`ICacheClient` interface](https://github.com/exceptionless/Foundatio/blob/master/src/Core/Caching/ICacheClient.cs):

1. [InMemoryCacheClient](https://github.com/exceptionless/Foundatio/blob/master/src/Core/Caching/InMemoryCacheClient.cs): An in memory cache client implementation.
2. [HybridCacheClient](https://github.com/exceptionless/Foundatio/blob/master/src/Core/Caching/HybridCacheClient.cs): This cache implementation uses the `InMemoryCacheClient` and uses the `IMessageBus` to keep the cache in sync across processes.
3. [RedisCacheClient](https://github.com/exceptionless/Foundatio/blob/master/src/Redis/Cache/RedisCacheClient.cs):
4. [RedisHybridCacheClient](https://github.com/exceptionless/Foundatio/blob/master/src/Redis/Cache/RedisHybridCacheClient.cs): This cache implementation uses both the `RedisCacheClient` and `InMemoryCacheClient` implementations and uses the `RedisMessageBus` to keep the in memory cache in sync across processes. This can lead to huge wins in performance as you are saving a serialization operation and call to redis if the item exists in the local cache.

We recommend using all of the `ICacheClient` implementations as singletons. 

#### Sample

```csharp
ICacheClient cache = new InMemoryCacheClient();
cache.Set("test", 1);
var value = cache.Get<int>("test");
```
